# Stylesheet

In order to build the MVP application with minimal delay we will be using Bootstrap to style the application.

Everyone is responsible for making sure their features are properly styled according to agreed upon standards. Unstyled or improperly styled code will not be merged.

DO NOT create custom CSS for elements unless absolutely necessary.

Using Bootstrap during the MVP phase will allow you to easily apply custom styling later in the project, as well as making it easier for you to make the site responsive and/or mobile friendly.

NOTE: If you can acheive the same functionality using Angular and using Bootstrap, use the Angular functionality. This will make it easier to change themes or stylings later.

* Initially, the site should be optimized for desktop sizes. The sidebars should be 4 columns and the main div should be 8 columns.

* The sidebar should be an info-panel containing an unstyled list.

* The main div should be a well.

* Top Bar buttons corresponding to the current view should be Active

* Top Bar buttons should be disabled if the link doesn't correspond to the view.

* Buttons which complete actions (save, update) should be Success buttons. 

*  Student Curriculum sidebar and Admin curriculum sidebar should be cohesively styled.

* Selected lessons should be background highlighted in sidebar.

* Communicate between teams to ensure no conflicts in styling.
